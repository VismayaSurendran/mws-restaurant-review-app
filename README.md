				#Project - Restaurant Reviews



For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, a static webpage was converted to a mobile-ready web application.
Converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.
Added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

How to load:

* Clone/download the repository.
* Start up a  HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.
* Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python.
For most people, it's already installed on your computer.


In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.
If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 2000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 2000`.
* If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:2000`.
